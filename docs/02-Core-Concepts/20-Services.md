# Kubernetes Services
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/services-3/)
  
In this section we will take a look at **`services`** in kubernetes

## Services
- Kubernetes Services enables communication between various components within and outside of the application.

#### Let's look at some other aspects of networking

## External Communication

- How do we as an **`external user`** access the **`web page`**?

  - From the node (Able to reach the application as expected)

  - From outside world (This should be our expectation, without something in the middle it will not reach the application)

 ## Service Types
 
 #### There are 3 types of service types in kubernetes
 
   ![srv-types](../../images/srv-types.PNG)
 
 1. NodePort
    - Where the service makes an internal port accessible on a port on the NODE.
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       types: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
      ```
     ![srvnp](../../images/srvnp.PNG)
      
      #### To connect the service to the pod
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       type: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
       selector:
         app: myapp
         type: front-end
       ```

    ![srvnp1](../../images/srvnp1.PNG)
      
      #### To create the service
      ```
      $ kubectl create -f service-definition.yaml
      ```
      
      #### To list the services
      ```
      $ kubectl get services
      ```
      
      #### To access the application from CLI instead of web browser
      ```
      $ curl http://192.168.1.2:30008
      ```
      
      ![srvnp2](../../images/srvnp2.PNG)

      #### A service with multiple pods
      
      ![srvnp3](../../images/srvnp3.PNG)
      
      #### When Pods are distributed across multiple nodes

 1. ClusterIP
    - In this case the service creates a **`Virtual IP`** inside the cluster to enable communication between different services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of backend servers.
    
 2. LoadBalancer
    - Where the service provisions a **`loadbalancer`** for our application in supported cloud providers.
   
 3. Reverse Proxy/Software Load Balancer:
    If you need full control over routing and load balancing, you can use a reverse proxy or software-based load balancer, like HAProxy or NGINX, to route traffic to your Kubernetes services.

4. Ingress-Controller:
   If you want to expose multiple services externally and avoid the limitations of NodePort, you can use an Ingress Controller. Ingress provides more advanced traffic routing and management.

   How it works:
     An Ingress Controller manages Ingress resources, which define rules for routing external HTTP(S) traffic to different Services inside the cluster.
     It acts as a reverse proxy that handles incoming requests and forwards them to the appropriate services based on defined rules (e.g., paths or hostnames).
     An Ingress Controller can be used with various tools, including NGINX, Traefik, or HAProxy.
